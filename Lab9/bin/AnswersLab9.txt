Answers for Lab 9
-----------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 1

1. What are the values of x, arr[0], and arr[1] in lines 20, 24, and 27 of MemoryDemo.java?
	x = 2
	arr[0] = 5
	arr[1] = 6

2. If the value of x set in line 18 did not change in method m1 explain why.
	The scope of x is within the main method. Since x is a primitive variable, the value of x was sent as a parameter.

3. Explain which of arr[0] or arr[1] were changed in methods m2() or m3() and why these values were changed.
	arr[0] was changing because arr was sent as an argument to m2. Since arr is a reference variable, the address of the array was sent not its values.
	Therefore the changes made to arr in the method actually changed the values in arr[0]. arr[1] didn't change because the value of arr[1] was sent.

	m2, m3, m3
	m1 record was removed.

EXERCISE 4

7. Which exception is thrown?
	StackOverflowError
	
8. Why is this exception thrown?
	The method never stops executing (infiinite recursions), therefore creating too many activity records
