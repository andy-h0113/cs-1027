EXERCISE 1

1. Which methods in the LinkedQueue class are taking in a parameter of the generic type T?

	enqueue() method	

2. Which methods in the LinkedQueue class have a return type of the generic type T?

	dequeue() method and first() method

3. Suppose you didn't have an instance variable storing the current number of elements in the queue. How could you determine the number of elements for the size() method if such an instance variable was not available?

	I could transverse the linked list and increment a counter for every node.

EXERCISE 2

4. Consider the possibility of using an Array Queue or a Circular Array Queue instead of the Linked Queue being used in this simulation. Would the simulation's results be impacted by switching to a different Queue implementation?

	No it would not, despite the different implementation the effects are the same.

5. Which of these classes/methods would you have to modify if you were going to use one of the other queue implementations?

	LinkedQueue would have to be modified heavily. Neither Snail.java or SnailRace.java would have to be modified.
