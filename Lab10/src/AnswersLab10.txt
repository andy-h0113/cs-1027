Exercise 1
1. What are the base cases of the recursive Fibonacci method?
	n == 1 or n == 2
2. Running times
          ifib        rfib 
n = 20    1ms         0ms
n = 30    0ms         5ms
n = 40    0ms  	      625ms
n = 45    0ms         7547ms
n = 50    0ms         53190ms

3. How many calls are made to rfib(2)?
	63245986

4. Why is the recursive algorithm for computing Fibonacci numbers so slow compared to the iterative algorithm? 
	You call the same method too many times

Exercise 2
5. Why is it difficult to design an iterative version of the algorithm for computing the Abo numbers?
	There are too many values of Abo that you need to keep track of which is difficult using an iterative method.
